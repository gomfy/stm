#### Dockerfile

```
### Get base image
FROM rocker/r-ubuntu:18.04
# As long as the above image doesn't get updated this should fix all of the package versions, which is important for reproducibility.


### Install additional packages (some of them are needed by devtools)
RUN apt-get update && \
    apt-get install -y \
    build-essential=12.4ubuntu1 \
    wget=1.19.4-1ubuntu2.2 \
    vim=2:8.0.1453-1ubuntu1.1 \
    libxml2-dev=2.9.4+dfsg1-6.1ubuntu1.2 \
    libssl-dev=1.1.1-1ubuntu2.1~18.04.4 \
    libcurl4-openssl-dev=7.58.0-2ubuntu3.8
# The above package versions are all fixed so these should not create a problem for stm reproducibility 


### Create directory      
RUN mkdir -p /install
RUN mkdir -p /run
RUN mkdir -p /input
RUN mkdir -p /output
# /install - holds the R install script
# /run - holds the default run script
# /input - can be used to mount a directory from the host system for input files
# /output - can be used to mount a directory from the host system for output files
# /input and /output allow for easy file transfers between the container and the host system

### Copy files
COPY docker_install.R /install/install.R
# Copy the desired install script named docker_install.R to the container's /install directory. The docker_install.R needs to reside in the PATH specified in the build command. E.g. if your build command is "docker build -t name/image ." then it needs to reside in the directory where docker build command is executed from.
COPY docker_run.R /run/run.R
# Copy the desired default run script named docker_run.R to the container's /run directory. The docker_run.R needs to reside in the PATH specified in the build command. E.g. if your build command is "docker build -t name/image ." then it needs to reside in the directory where docker build command is executed from.
RUN Rscript /install/install.R
# Run the install script to install desired R packages
CMD ["Rscript", "/run/run.R"]
# Specify a default command. This command will be executed if the "docker run" command has no arguments
```
#### R install script

```
install.packages(c("devtools", "stringr"))
library(devtools)
install_github("bstewart/stm",dependencies=TRUE)
``` 

#### Default R script

```
library(stringr)
library(stm)

mod <- stm(poliblog5k.docs, poliblog5k.voc, K=10, prevalence=~rating, data=poliblog5k.meta, max.em.its = 100)

fname = str_c("../output/",format(Sys.time(), "%H-%M-%S"), ".mod")
save(mod, file = fname)
```

#### Building a custom image
- Using the above `Dockerfile` you can customize the image you build by modifying the `docker_install.R` script and the `docker_run.R` script. The former controls what R packages will be included in the container, the latter what the default run script should be.
- Note it is possible to install additional R packages in a live image but the changes may not be saved unless you do some extra steps.
- To build the container execute the command: `docker build -t <your-name>/<your-container-name> <PATH>`
- Where you replace `<your-name>` with your [dockerhub](https://hub.docker.com/) username and `<your-container-name>` with a desired name for your container, and `<PATH>` with the path to the directory containing the `Dockerfile` and any files that you copy or add into the container in our case the `docker_install.R` and `docker_run.R` scripts.
- Further instructions on the `docker build` command can be found on [the docker website](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/build/).

#### Running an image
- Once you have an image there is many ways you can use it. The most important ways for this project would be the following:
    - **Default** run: `docker run --rm <your-name>/<your-container-name>`, which will run the default run, which is the last `[CMD]` statement in the `Dockerfile` in the above case it would be: `Rscript /run/run.R`
    - **With arguments**:  `docker run --rm <your-name>/<your-container-name> ARG1 ARG2 ...` For example, you could do: `Rscript` as `ARG1` and `/path/to/<my-other-run-script.R>` as `ARG2`, where `/path/to/<my-other-run-script.R>` needs to be a path within the container.
    - **Interactive mode**: `docker run --rm -it <your-name>/<your-container-name> /bin     /bash` This will put you inside the container where you can execute bash commands within the container.
    - **Mounting volumes mode**: `docker run --rm -v <host directory path>:<container directory path>  ARG1 ARG2 ...` This will allow you to mount a folder from the host path into the container's directory path. You can use this option if for example you would like to provide an input for the scripts in your container that's accessible from the host machine but is not part of the container. In that case, `<host directory paht>` is the path to the directory that contains the input and `<container directory path>` is the path within the container. **Important** make sure the directory in the container is an empty directory because everything will be overwritten with the host directory's content.
- Further instructions on the `docker run` command can be found on [the docker website](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/run/).
